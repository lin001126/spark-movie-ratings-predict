The project focuses on feature engineering for ml-25m dataset. It starts by splitting the genres column into multiple sub-columns and counting the number of movies per genre to analyze genre distribution. It then transforms each genre into an indicator variable to gauge user interest in different movie genres. The file employs TF-IDF for processing the genres column into a 20-element feature vector, extracts average movie ratings and user scores to understand popularity, and generates new features like the average rating per tag and the weight of the top three tags for each movie. Due to poor regression model performance, it incorporates ALS model predictions as a feature to enhance the feature vector.
